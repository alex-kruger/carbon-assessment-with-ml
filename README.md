## Carbon assessment with machine learning
This code repository presents a machine learning based method for selection of an Environmental Impact Factor (EIF) for a given product, material, or activity, which is a fundamental step of carbon footprinting. The code documents the methods in the following research papers.

## Installation
Required packages are given `requirements.txt`
Run the following commands to install the package:

## Dataset
The dataset is for research purposes only, and is not indicative of Amazonâ€™s business use for carbon footprinting.

The dataset consists of retail products mapped to North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. The mapping was done with Amazon Mechanical Turk, aggregating ground truth from 5 annotations per product. The dataset is the basis of estimating the carbon emissions of a product using Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA). Dataset is stored as a Pandas dataframe.
